" :Move:                Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
" :Rename:              Like :Move, but relative to the current file's containing directory.

" :Mkdir:               Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.

" :Locate:              Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
